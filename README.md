The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM,Logistic Regression etc
I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. 
Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
